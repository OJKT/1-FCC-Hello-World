<a href="#footer">Jump to Bottom</a>
<!--
<p>to make things faster to edit, I am going to add a jump to bottom link at the top of the code text. 
Just another repository, to share with friends and collaborators intrested </p>
<p>kitty ipsum and lorum ipsum... yes I'm not so smart and clued up on code yet, but as far as I am aware there are many coding languages and theese are two I've never heard before but must be very similar. I have heard of Python and Cali Linux and will hopefully one day learn theese too</p>
<p>CTRL slash / allows me to make this bit un-hidden and hide with as seen as a web developer and not a net browser.
I'm going to attemp to create a NET Bot and other material on my acount... and use it as notes and material for future projects I do to refer back onto

<p>I have attempted to put in photos one with a link, but I think github has a block on them possibly, which is understandable, therefore I will now try written links<p>
	
<a href="http://killojoulesstyle.simplesite.com/440660702" target="_blank">MyWebsite</a>
<p>the link to MyWebsite appears to be working, however it may not open a blank tab (new tab) like prompted to do so. The link to the bottom seems to be working in the html bar above, I presume there is a block to internal links. (# At least I know it would work if coded with other software). I have attempted to simplify the anchor elements code but it seemed to make matters worse</p>

<!-- a (href="#") is a link you are not sure where will link to yet, internal and external links use a hashtag -->
